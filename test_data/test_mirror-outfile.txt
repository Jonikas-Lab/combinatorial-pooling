<IGNORE> This is written to be compared to an output file using testing_utilities.compare_files_with_regex: All the <REGEX> lines will be matched to the output file lines as regular expressions instead of requiring the lines to be identical, and all the <IGNORE> lines (like this one) will be ignored in the comparison.
<IGNORE> Remember the REGEX lines are now regular expressions, so some characters need to be escaped!

<IGNORE> The Biomek outfile filenames are given as test_.*_ rather than containing the real testname because test-run output files that will be compared to these reference files obviously must have different names.

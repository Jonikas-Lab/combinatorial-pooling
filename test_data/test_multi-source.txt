<IGNORE> This is written to be compared to an output file using testing_utilities.compare_files_with_regex: All the <REGEX> lines will be matched to the output file lines as regular expressions instead of requiring the lines to be identical, and all the <IGNORE> lines (like this one) will be ignored in the comparison.
<IGNORE> Remember the REGEX lines are now regular expressions, so some characters need to be escaped!

<IGNORE> This is written to be compared to an output file using testing_utilities.compare_files_with_regex: All the <REGEX> lines will be matched to the output file lines as regular expressions instead of requiring the lines to be identical, and all the <IGNORE> lines (like this one) will be ignored in the comparison.
<IGNORE> Remember the REGEX lines are now regular expressions, so some characters need to be escaped!

<IGNORE> The Biomek outfile filenames are given as test_.*_ rather than containing the real testname because test-run output files that will be compared to these reference files obviously must have different names.
<IGNORE> I'm using symlinks to this outfile for multiple tests with different Biomek outfile setups (mirror or not, multiple or not), so I'm just leaving a general regex here
<REGEX># Corresponding Biomek command file\(s\): .*
# Total 7 samples into 3 pools (and 0 mirror pools)
transfers from samples: 1-3 per sample (20-60 ul), total 12 transfers
transfers into pools: 4-4 per pool (80-80 ul), total 12 transfers

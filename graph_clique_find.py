# It would be nice to have a clique_find implementation that didn't modify the original graph...  NOT WORTH IT. 
#   I'd need to write custom deepcopy for my classes, and then copy the original but NOT at each recursion step... 
#   Anyway this is for one specific case of finding the clique, where I won't need the original back, so who cares.

# Thinking about implementation: if there is a clique, it must contain some nodes and not contain other nodes. so either start removing unknown_nodes from the graph and checking for cliqueness, or marking unknown_nodes as required_nodes (and then removing everything that's not its neighbor, and I suppose even removing it too and checking for a N-1 clique!) - try this for each node, and recurse down.  Which way would be better?  Depends on how the graph size compares to the clique size, really - if we have an N+1 graph and are looking for an N-clique, removing will be faster, but if we have a 4N graph, probably the other will be faster?  Anyway, removing seems cleaner, try that for now.
